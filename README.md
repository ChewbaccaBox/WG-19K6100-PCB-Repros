# Wells Gardener 19K6100 PCB Repros

***THIS PROJECT IS INCOMPLETE AND STILL IN PROGRESS***

So far, a P314, P15, and P123, and the IPC have been stripped, scanned, and reassembled for this project.
That's at least one of each of the categories of boards. 
Right now, I'm mostly focusing on scanning the PCBs and not much further. 
But it would allow anyone to use these in any way, like repros, 3D models, etc.

**History of PCB revisions**

Tempest 	-81	  - Used P314, P315, P316\
Later Tempests	-late 81 - Added IPC onto P314 for input protection.\
Later Vectors 	-82 / 83 - Used P327, P328, P329\
Last Vectors   	-83	 - Used P339, P341, P329\
Aztarac		      -83  	 - Used 6400, aka P322, P324, P341
